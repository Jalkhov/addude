Speed up the packing or compression of your extensions for **Firefox**, **Chrome**, **Palemoon**... Yes, basically this tool is a compressor like **Winrar**, but here you have the possibility to exclude the files you want from the final file and avoid the tedious task (or at least for me) of using the context menu to compress and change the file extension to **xpi** or **crx**. Remember that the extensions must be packed from the folder elements, but not compress the folder as explained [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/orphaned/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Package_your_extension_#1._comprime_los_archivos_en_un_zip), so Addude uses this same hierarchy for packing.
